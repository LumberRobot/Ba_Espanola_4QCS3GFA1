        <p>The non-profit organization The Forest Foundation Philippines was founded with the goal of defending the Philippine forests from harm. Grants are given to organizations that help people protect forests. Their mission is to protect the country's most critical forest landscapes: Sierra Madre, palawan, Samar and Leyte, and Bukidnon an Misamis Oriental (bayanacademy, n.d.). </p>
        <p class="reasons">Firstly, Forest Foundation Philippines is dedicated to the preservation of biodiversity by protecting forests and their ecosystems. There are many plant and animal species there, many of which are specific to forests as habitats. Secondly, Forests are essential for minimizing the effects of climate change because they absorb and store atmospheric carbon dioxide. Forest Foundation Philippines supports reforestation and restoration projects to promote carbon sequestration. Lastly, the Foundation is committed to supporting neighborhood communities by encouraging sustainable land-use methods and offering employment opportunities. By providing training and tools, the Foundation aims to encourage business opportunities that are compatible with protecting forests.</p>
